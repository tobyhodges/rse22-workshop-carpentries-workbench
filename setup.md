To follow the workshop, participants will need to bring a laptop with 
a working [installation of RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) 
and [R version 4.1 or higher](https://www.r-project.org/).
(To download and install R, 
follow the link to https://www.r-project.org/, 
follow the “CRAN” link near the top-left of that page, 
and choose a mirror close to your location.)

Participants will also need a GitHub account with credentials set up 
to enable pushing changes to GitHub. 
Choose one of the following two options for these credentials:

1. SSH keys - 
   the Software Carpentry _Version Control with Git_ lesson includes 
   [a guide for how to set up SSH keys for connecting to GitHub](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/07-github/index.html#3-ssh-background-and-setup)
2. a personal access token -
   _Happy Git with R_ provides 
   [a guide for how to set up an access token for GitHub with R](https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html)
