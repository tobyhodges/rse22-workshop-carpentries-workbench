## Workshop Prerequisites

Participants should be familiar with how to write formatted text (bold, italic, bullet point lists, etc) with Markdown, and the fundamentals of git for version control (add, commit, push, pull, remotes). Some familiarity with an integrated development environment, especially RStudio, would be particularly beneficial.
:::

In this workshop, participants will explore the ecosystem of processes, resources, 
and infrastructure that supports lesson development in [The Carpentries][carpentries] community.
The first part of the workshop will provide participants with some steps to follow 
to help them design and develop a high-quality lesson. 
In the second part, participants will be able to follow an interactive demonstration
of the key features of [The Carpentries Workbench][workbench],
and discover how they can use the infrastructure to create their own lesson websites. 

The target audience for this workshop is RSEs who provide training as part of their role
or in a voluntary capacity (e.g. as an Instructor with The Carpentries). 
It will be especially relevant to RSEs who wish to develop an open source lesson
using the approaches and infrastructure presented in the session.
