# Collaborative Lesson Development with The Carpentries Workbench

Materials for a workshop at [RSECon22](https://rsecon2022.society-rse.org/).

## Abstract

[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) teaches software and data skills to researchers and librarians all over the world.
[Our Instructor Training program](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/) promotes 
good teaching practices, grounded in research findings in educational psychology.
Certified Instructors teach lessons developed and maintained by the community in short-format workshops.
These lessons are developed in open source repositories and published online with a permissive CC-BY license.

In 2022, The Carpentries is releasing [The Carpentries Workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/workbench/), 
a completely new infrastructure for lesson websites, designed with accessibility as a central guiding principle.
The Workbench has been built with a single purpose: 
to make it easier for our community to build, maintain, and teach lessons.
We hope that RSEs will use the infrastructure to create training material that
shares their skills and promotes better research software.

In this workshop, participants will explore the ecosystem of processes, resources, and infrastructure
that supports lesson development in The Carpentries community.
The first part of the workshop will provide participants with some steps to follow
to help them design and develop a high-quality lesson.
In the second part, participants will be able to follow an interactive demonstration of
the key features of The Carpentries Workbench,
and discover how they can use the infrastructure to create their own lesson websites.

## Target Audience

The Carpentries lesson infrastructure is well-suited to the development of lessons
teaching software and computational research skills.
The target audience for this workshop is RSEs who provide training as part of their role or 
in a voluntary capacity (e.g. as an Instructor with The Carpentries).
It will be especially relevant to RSEs who wish to develop an open source lesson
using the approaches and infrastructure presented in the session.

Workshop participants should be familiar with how to write formatted text
(bold, italic, bullet point lists, etc) with Markdown,
and the fundamentals of git for version control 
(`add`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`, remotes). 
Some familiarity with an integrated development environment, especially RStudio, would be particularly beneficial.
