## The Carpentries

The Carpentries builds global capacity in essential data and computational skills
for conducting efficient, open, and reproducible research. 
We train and foster an active, inclusive, diverse community of learners and instructors
that promotes and models the importance of software and data in research. 
We collaboratively develop openly-available lessons and deliver these lessons 
using evidence-based teaching practices. 
We focus on people conducting and supporting research.

All of our lessons are open source, hosted on GitHub, 
and published under a CC-BY license. 

Carpentries Instructors, who are mostly volunteering their time to teach,
have taught more than 3600 workshops, in more than 70 countries, 
across all seven continents.
In addition to these Instructors, there are many other roles that people take on
in The Carpentries community. For example, we have:

- **Maintainers**, who take care of the day-to-day upkeep of our open source lessons;
- **Trainers**, who teach and certify new Instructors through our Instructor Training program;
- and **Curriculum Advisors**, who provide high-level guidance on the overall direction of our curricula.

## Lesson Development in The Carpentries

Our official lessons are divided across three Lesson Programs:
Software Carpentry,
Library Carpentry,
and Data Carpentry.
Each of these programs has a slightly different focus, 
either in their target audience or in the skills they teach,
but all share a common goal of promoting efficiency and reproducibility
in research and research-related disciplines.

In addition to The Carpentries official lessons, our community members
use our open source infrastructure to create lessons of their own.
This community development of new lessons is taking place in The Carpentries Incubator,
a space for the community to collaborate on their own lessons with support from
other community members and The Carpentries Core Team.

The Carpentries Incubator forms the first part of a pathway for the development of lessons,
which can lead to open peer review and publication, and/or adoption by one of The Carpentries lesson programs as a new official lesson.

We are not going to talk any more about that pathway for lesson development today,
because we are also presenting a poster on exactly that topic at this conference.
Come and find us there during the poster session - or any other time during the week -
to talk more about our systems and processes for lesson development, review, and publication!

## The Carpentries Workbench

TODO

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- The Carpentries is a global community teaching software and data skills. Their primary audience is researchers and librarians.
- The Carpentries community develops and maintains open source lesson websites, hosted by GitHub Pages.
- The Carpentries Workbench is a completely new infrastructure for building lesson websites.
- The Workbench was created to provide a lesson infrastructure that empowers community members to write and maintain accessible lessons.
