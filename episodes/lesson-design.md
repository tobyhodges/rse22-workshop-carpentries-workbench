## Lesson Design

TODO

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- When designing a new lesson, we recommend starting by identifying your target audience, thinking about what they already know, and what you want them to be able to do by the end of the lesson.
- Backwards lesson design is an iterative process for lesson design and development that focuses on the desirable, observable behaviours the lesson should teach to learners.
- Lessons are being developed in The Carpentries Incubator. You can go there to find an existing lesson to contribute to, or to propose a new lesson of your own.
