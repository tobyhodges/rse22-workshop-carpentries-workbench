:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- How do I approach the design for a new lesson?
- What is backwards lesson design?
- How can I get started with lesson development in The Carpentries?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Identify some advantages of an approach to lesson design that focuses on learner outcomes.
- Define a backwards design process for lessons.
- Find existing lesson projects in The Carpentries community.
- Propose a new lesson for development in The Carpentries Incubator.

## Lesson Design

- Training can come in many forms - from one-on-one mentoring, through semester-long modules, to massive online courses taken by thousands of people on their own schedule.
- In The Carpentries, our focus is on short-format training: workshops that usually last ~2 days.
- It is in this context that our community develops lessons.
- All training should be centered on the learners - who are they and what do they want to learn? What do you want to make sure they know how to do by the time they leave your lesson?
- This can take a bit of getting used to: we must be prepared to forget about the things we most enjoy teaching, and try to focus instead on the things that are most important for learners to understand and be able to do. 
- This is even more true in a short training, where we must always make compromises due to limited time in a workshop.
- To help guide us in developing a lesson that will be most effective in teaching learners what we really want them to know, we try to adopt an approach to lesson design that emphasises learner outcomes.
- When used effectively, this approach to lesson design also helps us to identify what we can cut out if we find that we need to make space or fit the lesson into a shorter timeframe.


## Backwards Design

- introduce backwards design
- explain importance of learning objectives/outcomes
- give example of a good objective, examples of verbs
- formative assessment
- examples of exercise formats
- exercise: what verbs would an exercise of each kind assess?
  - more appropriate for novice or intermediate learners?


### Teaching is an Intermediate Step in the Lesson Design Process

- No lesson is perfect - "Perfect only takes so long because it don't exist."
- Rather than agonising over the best way to teach something, choose one approach to try, teach it, gather feedback, reflect on the experience, and use that information to iterate on the lesson and improve it for next time
- Pilot workshops are an essential part of the lesson design process
- figure of lesson life cycle


## The Carpentries Incubator

- We provide support for all stages of this life cycle
- Training
- Templates
- Communications & networking
- Building a community of practice around lesson development - collaborate with others and re-use lessons
- Infrastructure (the rest of this workshop)


## How can RSEs Help?

- RSEs know what skills researchers (and RSEs!) need to learn
- They often have teaching responsibilities
- Develop new lessons, contribute to existing ones teaching these skills
- Teach lessons and provide feedback
- Review lessons written by others
- Come talk to me at the post for more information

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- When designing a new lesson, we recommend starting by identifying your target audience, thinking about what they already know, and what you want them to be able to do by the end of the lesson.
- Backwards lesson design is an iterative process for lesson design and development that focuses on the desirable, observable behaviours the lesson should teach to learners.
- Lessons are being developed in The Carpentries Incubator. You can go there to find an existing lesson to contribute to, or to propose a new lesson of your own.
